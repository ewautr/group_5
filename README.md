For the Mandatory Assignment 1 have we created an app working as a banking system. The project is written in Django.
The project system consists of two apps: one for login and one for the banking system. We have split them into two different apps since the login app can be used for different apps and projects. By doing so are we avoiding redundant data and functions.
The banking system is build based on the listed requirements for the Mandatory Assignment 1.
